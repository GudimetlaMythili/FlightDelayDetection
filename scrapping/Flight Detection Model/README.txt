The creation of a flight delay prediction model starts with collecting and preprocessing relevant data such as flight schedules, departure/arrival times, weather conditions, airline information, and airport traffic. After cleaning the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, normalizing numerical ones), relevant features are selected or engineered to improve model performance. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. A suitable machine learning algorithmâ€”such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest are used
